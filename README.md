# LabTvJS
LabForTraning project emulating the functionalities of streaming services using HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This is only a first attempt at emulating a basic interface for a streaming services from a visual perspective.
This project is meant to be an excercise in creating a functional Javascript code that modifies the view by injecting directly the HTML with elements.
The application is not optimized for mobile devices (The view is not complete and fully responsive so not all portions are visible).
